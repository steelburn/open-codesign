> Your prompts. Your model. Your laptop.
>
> Turn prompts into polished artifacts — locally, openly, and with whichever model you already pay for.

## What it is

Turn a prompt into a polished prototype, slide deck, or marketing asset, locally, with the model you already use.

**Open CoDesign is the open-source Claude Design alternative** — built for people who want the speed of AI-native design tools without subscription lock-in, cloud-only workflows, or being forced onto a single provider. An MIT-licensed desktop app, local-first from day one, with BYOK for any model (Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint). One-click import of your existing Claude Code or Codex API key gets you running in under 90 seconds.

---

## See it generate

From a blank prompt to a finished artifact, the agent plans, writes, self-checks, and ships something with hover states, tabs, and empty states already wired up:

---

## Why people star it

- **Runs on your laptop** — no mandatory cloud workspace
- **Works with your model** — Claude, GPT, Gemini, Ollama, OpenRouter, and more
- **Exports real files** — HTML, PDF, PPTX, ZIP, Markdown
- **Shows its work** — live agent activity, visible tool calls, interruptible generation

---

## Why Open CoDesign?

Open source, desktop-native, and built for people who do not want their design workflow locked to one model or one cloud.

## Quickstart

**Time to first artifact:** about 3 minutes

**Requires:** one API key or local Ollama

**Runs on:** macOS 12+ (Monterey or later), Windows 10+, Linux (glibc ≥ 2.31)

### 1. Install

**Direct download** (v0.1.x) from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/OpenCoworkAI/open-codesign/releases):

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `open-codesign-*-arm64.dmg` |
| macOS (Intel) | `open-codesign-*-x64.dmg` |
| Windows (x64) | `open-codesign-*-x64-setup.exe` |
| Windows (ARM64) | `open-codesign-*-arm64-setup.exe` |
| Linux (x64) | `open-codesign-*-x64.AppImage` |

Each release ships with `SHA256SUMS.txt` and a CycloneDX SBOM (`*-sbom.cdx.json`) so you can verify what you downloaded.

<details>
<summary><b>Package managers</b> — status for v0.1.x</summary>

| Manager | Command | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Homebrew Cask (macOS) | `brew install --cask opencoworkai/tap/open-codesign` | 🟢 Live |
| Scoop (Windows) | `scoop bucket add opencoworkai https://github.com/OpenCoworkAI/scoop-bucket && scoop install open-codesign` | 🟢 Live |
| winget (Windows) | `winget install OpenCoworkAI.OpenCoDesign` | 🟠 [PR #363055](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/pull/363055) under Microsoft review |
| Flathub (Linux) | `flatpak install flathub ai.opencowork.codesign` | ⏸ Deferred to v0.2 (needs signed build + AppStream metadata) |
| Snap (Linux) | `snap install --dangerous open-codesign-*.snap` | 🟡 Attached to releases best-effort; Snap Store publish not yet wired |

After each tag push, CI auto-syncs SHAs back into `packaging/` and (once the winget PR merges) auto-opens downstream bumps. Every `packaging/*/README.md` documents its own mirror flow.
</details>

> **v0.1 note:** installers are unsigned. On **macOS Sequoia 15+** right-click → Open no longer bypasses Gatekeeper, and "Open Anyway" in System Settings often fails. Reliable one-liner:
>
> ```sh
> xattr -cr "/Applications/Open CoDesign.app"
> ```
>
> Then double-click normally. (Older 0.1.x builds are installed as `/Applications/open-codesign.app`.)
> On **Windows**: SmartScreen → More info → Run anyway.
>
> Want a verified build? Compile from source — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### 2. Add your API key

On first launch, Open CoDesign opens the Settings page. Paste any supported provider key:

- Anthropic (`sk-ant-…`)
- OpenAI (`sk-…`)
- Google Gemini
- Any OpenAI-compatible relay (OpenRouter, SiliconFlow, local Ollama)

Credentials stay in `~/.config/open-codesign/config.toml` (file mode 0600, same convention as Claude Code, Codex, and `gh` CLI). Nothing leaves your machine unless your chosen model provider requires it.

### 3. Type your first prompt

Pick one of **fifteen built-in demos** — landing page, dashboard, pitch slide, pricing, mobile app, chat UI, event calendar, blog article, receipt/invoice, portfolio, settings panel, and more — or describe your own. A sandboxed prototype appears in seconds.

---

## Bring your stack

Already using Claude Code or Codex? Your providers, models, and API keys import in one click, with no copy-paste and no need to re-enter settings:

![Import from Claude Code or Codex in one click](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenCoworkAI/open-codesign/main/website/public/demos/claude-code-import.gif)

---

## Built-in taste

Generic AI tools tend to produce generic output. Open CoDesign ships with **twelve built-in design skill modules** — slide decks, dashboards, landing pages, SVG charts, glassmorphism, editorial typography, heroes, pricing, footers, chat UIs, data tables, and calendars — plus a built-in taste layer that steers the model toward considered typography, purposeful whitespace, and meaningful color.

Every skill is available in every generation. Before the model writes a line of CSS, it selects the skills that fit the brief and reasons through layout intent, design-system coherence, and contrast, bringing higher-quality design behavior to whichever model you choose.

Add a `SKILL.md` to any project to teach the model your own taste.

---

## What you get

### Models and providers
- **Unified provider model** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, SiliconFlow, local Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible relay; keyless (IP-allowlisted) proxies supported
- **One-click import** from Claude Code and Codex configs — bring your existing providers, models, and keys in a single click
- **Dynamic model picker** — every provider exposes its real model catalogue, not a hardcoded shortlist

### Generation and editing
- **Prompt → HTML or JSX/React component** prototype, rendered in a sandboxed iframe (vendored React 18 + Babel on-device)
- **Fifteen built-in demos + twelve design skill modules** — ready-to-edit starting points for common design briefs
- **Live agent panel** — watch tool calls stream in real time as the model edits files
- **AI-generated sliders** — the model emits the parameters worth tweaking (color, spacing, font)
- **Comment mode** — click any element in the preview to drop a pin, leave a note, and let the model rewrite only that region
- **Generation cancellation** — stop mid-stream without losing prior turns

### Preview and workflow
- **Phone / tablet / desktop preview** — true responsive frames, switch with one click
- **Files panel** — inspect multi-file artifacts (HTML, CSS, JS) before export
- **Instant design switching** — the last five designs keep their preview iframes alive, so Hub ↔ Workspace and sidebar navigation stay zero-delay
- **Connection diagnostic panel** — one-click test for any provider, with actionable errors
- **Per-generation token counter** — see exactly how many tokens each run cost in the sidebar
- **Settings with four tabs** — Models, Appearance, Storage, and Advanced
- **Light + dark themes**, **EN + 简体中文 UI** with live toggle

### Export and packaging
- **Five export formats** — HTML (inlined CSS), PDF (local Chrome), PPTX, ZIP, Markdown
- **GitHub Release pipeline** — unsigned DMG (macOS), EXE (Windows), AppImage (Linux). Code-signing lands in v0.5 along with opt-in auto-update

---

## What’s next

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Cost transparency — pre-generation estimate + weekly budget (per-generation token count already shipped) | 🔜 Coming |
| Version snapshots + side-by-side diff | 🔜 Coming |
| Codebase → design system (token extraction) | 🔜 Coming |
| Three-style parallel exploration | 🔜 Coming |
