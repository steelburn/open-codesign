## Overview

A warm editorial system with crisp product UI structure. Use it as a starting
baton, then replace tokens with project-specific choices once the visual
direction is resolved.

## Colors

Use background and surface for page depth, text and muted for hierarchy, border
for quiet separation, and accent for primary actions or data highlights.

## Typography

Display type carries high-emphasis headings. Body type should stay practical and
readable for navigation, tables, controls, and explanatory copy.

## Layout

Use a 12-column desktop rhythm, a two-column tablet rhythm, and a single-column
mobile rhythm. Keep content max widths explicit and avoid accidental horizontal
scroll.

## Elevation & Depth

Prefer tonal separation and fine borders before large shadows. Raised surfaces
should feel attached to the system, not floating above it.

## Shapes

Use small radii for controls and medium-to-large radii for panels. Nested
surfaces should never have a larger radius than their parent.

## Components

Primary buttons are direct and high contrast. Cards hold one clear job: status,
record detail, comparison, form group, or content module.

## Do's and Don'ts

Do promote repeated visual choices back into this file. Don't paste transient
task notes, long source files, or unverified brand values here.
