## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 76a0043: feat(i18n): add full Spanish (ES) language support

  Added comprehensive Spanish (Neutral Latin American) localization.

  - Translated 889 core i18n keys in `packages/i18n`.
  - Translated dashboard templates and examples catalog in `packages/templates`.
  - Registered 'es' locale in the UI (LanguageToggle and Settings).
  - Updated IPC handlers in `apps/desktop` to support Spanish locale persistence.

- 4cec7ea: fix: tighten Always Reportable architecture after 3-reviewer audit

  Follow-up to the Always Reportable refactor, consolidating 3 parallel reviews (architecture / privacy / UX).

  **Privacy hardening:**

  - IPC validators (`parseReportableError`, `parseRecordRendererErrorInput`) cap `message` at 8 KB, `stack` at 16 KB, `context` at 4 KB serialized. Previously a compromised renderer could DoS via 10 MB stack.
  - `reportEvent` handler recomputes the dedup fingerprint main-side instead of trusting the renderer-supplied value.
  - `recordRendererError` IPC echoes the main-computed `fingerprint` back so the in-memory record matches the persisted row.

  **Correctness:**

  - All four main-side `computeFingerprint` call sites now pass `message` alongside `errorCode`+`stack`, matching the renderer signature. Previously stack-less errors produced different fingerprints on the two sides, which broke the "you already reported this" dedup.
  - `applyGenerateError` reads `err.code` from the rejected IPC error so `ATTACHMENT_TOO_LARGE` / `PROVIDER_HTTP_4XX` / `CONFIG_MISSING` survive into the Report (previously flattened to a generic `GENERATION_FAILED`). `NormalizedProviderError` fields are forwarded into `ReportableError.context`, so the preview's upstream block fires for real provider failures.

  **UX:**

  - `reportableErrorToast` helper + migrated 13 existing `pushToast({variant:'error'})` sites (onboarding imports, provider test/save/delete/activate, model save, reasoning save, open-log-folder fail, onboarding-blocked inline comments). Each now ships with a meaningful `code` and `scope` for triage rather than the generic `RENDERER_ERROR`/`renderer` fallback.
  - Diagnostics panel falls back to rendering the in-memory `reportableErrors[]` when SQLite is unavailable, with a "showing in-memory — will not persist" banner. Previously a DB-down user had no way to find their dismissed toast errors.
  - Bundle-saved toast now always fires after the bundle is written, regardless of whether `openExternal` or `clipboard.writeText` succeeds afterward. On failure, a follow-up recovery toast includes a copy-URL / paste-manually hint.

- c962aca: feat: boot-phase failure fallback + 24h fingerprint dedup

  - If the app crashes before the logger is ready (corrupt config, unreadable DB, SafeStorage init throw), we now write a sync `boot-errors.log` to the logs dir (falls back to `os.tmpdir()` if the primary location fails) and show a native three-button dialog — Copy diagnostic path / Open log folder / Quit. Previously the app would silently exit or show an opaque message.
  - Before a user clicks Open Issue in the Report dialog, we check a local `reported-fingerprints.json` (scoped 24 h, mode 0600) for the event's fingerprint. If it matches a prior submission, the dialog shows a small inline note with the previous issue URL: "You reported the same issue yesterday at 14:32." The user can still proceed — the check is informational.
  - After any successful `reportEvent`, the fingerprint is recorded locally. Older entries are pruned on write.

- 4391788: feat(codex): unify ChatGPT subscription path onto pi-ai's built-in openai-codex-responses wire

  Phase 2 of the Codex subscription login work. The self-rolled Codex client
  path from Phase 1 is replaced by pi-ai's first-class `openai-codex-responses`
  adapter (shipped in pi-ai 0.67.68) so every provider — Anthropic, OpenAI,
  Gemini, ChatGPT Codex — now runs through the same core/pi-agent-core route
  with no provider-specific branching.

  ### Schema + routing

  - `packages/shared`: extend `WireApiSchema` and `CanonicalWire` with
    `openai-codex-responses`; promote `CHATGPT_CODEX_PROVIDER_ID` to shared so
    `provider-settings` references the same literal the OAuth module writes
    without creating a module cycle.
  - `canonicalBaseUrl` passes codex URLs through untouched (pi-ai's wire
    appends `/codex/responses` itself); `modelsEndpointUrl` throws for codex
    (no discoverable /models endpoint — providers use `modelsHint`).
  - `packages/core`, `packages/providers`: `apiForWire` + `synthesizeWireModel`
    recognize the new wire; all 4 duplicated `'openai-chat' | …` unions
    consolidated onto the shared `WireApi` type.

  ### Desktop wiring

  - New `apps/desktop/src/main/resolve-api-key.ts`: dependency-injected helper
    that routes ChatGPT provider id to the token store's auto-refreshing
    access token, and every other provider to the keychain-backed API key.
    Codex auth failures surface as `CodesignError(PROVIDER_AUTH_MISSING)` so
    the renderer's error-code routing stays consistent with the API-key-missing
    path. Covered by 7 unit tests via DI.
  - `main/index.ts`: `resolveActiveApiKeyFromState` replaces the inline
    `isChatgptCodex` validate / dispatch branches in all 4 IPC handlers
    (`codesign:v1:generate`, legacy `codesign:generate`, apply-comment,
    generate-title). Legacy `codesign:generate` no longer rejects codex.
  - Long-running agent runs: `GenerateInput.getApiKey` is a new optional async
    getter; the desktop passes it only for codex so pi-agent-core calls back
    into the token store on each LLM round-trip (auto-refreshes within the
    5-min buffer). Mid-run sign-out errors are captured in a closure variable
    and rethrown verbatim from the post-agent branch so the structured
    `PROVIDER_AUTH_MISSING` code isn't lost to pi-agent-core's plain-string
    failure-message flattening.

  ### Registration + migration

  - `codex-oauth-ipc.ts`: provider entry registers `wire=openai-codex-responses`,
    bare `baseUrl=https://chatgpt.com/backend-api`, and the full 9-model catalog
    (gpt-5.1 → gpt-5.4-mini), ordered flagship-first.
  - `migrateStaleCodexEntryIfNeeded()` runs once at boot and rewrites any
    Phase-1-shaped `chatgpt-codex` provider (`wire=openai-responses`,
    `baseUrl=/codex`) to the Phase 2 canonical values, so feat-branch testers
    don't need to sign out and back in after upgrade. No-op when the entry is
    absent or already canonical.

  ### UI

  - `ChatgptLoginCard.tsx`: flipped out of "coming soon" mode back to the full
    three-state login/status/logout flow, with i18n keys in both locales.

  ### Deletions (-963 LOC of Phase 1 code now provided by pi-ai)

  - `apps/desktop/src/main/codex-generate.ts` + test
  - `apps/desktop/src/main/codex-title.ts`
  - `packages/providers/src/codex/client.ts` + test

  OAuth-side code (`oauth.ts`, `oauth-server.ts`, `token-store.ts`) is unchanged
  — still the only codex-specific code, and it sits outside the generation link.

- 95412b9: feat: ChatGPT 订阅登录（Codex OAuth）

  支持用 ChatGPT Plus/Pro/Team 订阅直接调用 Codex 模型（`gpt-5.3-codex`、`gpt-5.4` 等），无需 API key。

  - PKCE OAuth 流程，本地 1455 端口 callback（冲突回退随机端口）
  - Token 存 `~/.config/open-codesign/codex-auth.json` (0600)，5 分钟过期前主动刷新，并发去重
  - 独立 token store，不与 Codex CLI 冲突
  - 生成请求走 `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`，401 自动刷新重试
  - Settings 里加 "用 ChatGPT 订阅登录" 卡片

  Phase 2 待做：流式响应、usage/cost 记账、图片附件、完整 craft-directives system prompt。

- 0a0ff2e: feat(settings): add CLIProxyAPI preset quick-pick

  Adds CLIProxyAPI (`router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI`) as a first-class preset in the Add Provider menu. CLIProxyAPI is a Go local proxy on port 8317 that wraps Claude/Codex/Gemini OAuth subscriptions into a unified Anthropic Messages API — heavily requested by the Chinese user base.

  - `packages/shared`: new `cli-proxy-api` entry in `PROXY_PRESETS` (anthropic wire, `http://127.0.0.1:8317`)
  - `packages/i18n`: `settings.providers.cliProxyApi.*` keys in both `en.json` and `zh-CN.json` (preset name, description, api-key-optional hint, thinking-budget hint, model discovery strings)
  - `apps/desktop`: `AddProviderMenu` gains a CLIProxyAPI item that opens `AddCustomProviderModal` pre-filled with the CPA endpoint and anthropic wire; claude-cli identity headers are injected automatically by the existing `shouldForceClaudeCodeIdentity` path (no extra code needed)

- 19b2909: feat: diagnostic events table + fingerprint-based dedup

  - New `diagnostic_events` SQLite table persists error-level events from renderer crashes, provider errors (`provider.error` / `provider.error.final`), and final `CodesignError` throws from `generate` / `applyComment` / `generateTitle` handlers.
  - 200 ms dedup window: repeated failures with the same fingerprint bump `count` on the existing row rather than inserting new rows, keeping the table small under retry storms.
  - New `computeFingerprint({ errorCode, stack })` in `@open-codesign/shared`: 8-char sha1 over error code + top-3 normalized stack frames. Stable across different users / paths / line numbers so "the same bug" collapses to one group.
  - Retry-in-flight events are marked `transient: true`; the default list view hides them (UI lands in PR4).
  - Startup prunes the events table to 500 newest rows.
  - New `RENDERER_ERROR` code for uncaught errors forwarded from the renderer bridge.

  No user-visible behavior yet — this is the storage layer for the PR4 Diagnostics panel and "Report this" flow.

- 6c3a908: feat: diagnostics panel + Report bug flow + i18n error codes

  Closes the user → maintainer triage loop that PR1/PR2/PR3 built the foundation for.

  **Users see:**

  - New Settings → Diagnostics tab listing recent errors (code, scope, runId, message preview) with filter for retried-then-succeeded transient errors.
  - Error toasts no longer auto-dismiss and carry a Report button that opens a preview dialog.
  - Report dialog shows the event + free-text notes field + redaction toggles (include prompt / paths / URLs / 60 s action timeline — sensible defaults: timeline ON, others OFF).
  - One click on Open Issue launches a GitHub new-issue URL pre-filled with the summary (error code, fingerprint, env, upstream request-id, stack top 5 frames, user notes). Zip bundle with the full log + redacted config + summary.md is saved to Downloads for manual attachment.
  - Topbar shows an unread-error badge that jumps to the Diagnostics tab.
  - Every error toast / dialog copy is translated into zh-CN.

  **Plumbing:**

  - Renderer action timeline (last 40 entries / 60 s): forbids prompt text / paths / URLs by schema. Populated from `store.ts` at prompt submit, cancel, retry, provider/skill switch, design export, connection test, onboarding.
  - Two new IPC channels: `diagnostics:v1:listEvents`, `diagnostics:v1:reportEvent`.
  - `context_json` column added to `diagnostic_events` (additive migration) so provider errors persist `upstream_request_id` / status / retry_count alongside the row — the Report dialog renders them without reparsing main.log.
  - Markdown composer `composeSummaryMarkdown` is pure + unit-tested — re-used for both bundle and issue body.
  - `userFacingKey` field on every ERROR_CODE_DESCRIPTIONS entry pairs with i18n `err.<CODE>` keys in both locales.

  **Foundation fixes merged in:**

  - Fingerprint degeneracy: provider errors now use a synthetic `at provider (<status>:<code>)` frame so the Diagnostics panel groups sensibly.
  - Duplicate fingerprinting: retry's `provider.error.final` no longer persists a separate row; the outer handler's `recordFinalError` is the single final-error write path.
  - `generateTitle` / `applyComment` errors now use distinct scopes (`title`, `apply-comment`) instead of being indistinguishable from real generations.

- 9938fa4: feat(desktop): per-design workspace folder linking

  Users can now bind any open design to a local folder directly from the Files panel. Every file the agent writes is mirrored to that folder in real time, and the binding persists across restarts.

  - **Bind on first use** — click "Choose folder" in the Files panel to pick a workspace directory; the design is linked immediately and files are synced.
  - **Rebind with migration** — choosing a different folder prompts a confirmation dialog; existing tracked files are copied to the new location before the binding switches.
  - **Clear binding** — a "Disconnect folder" action removes the link without touching files on disk.
  - **Error surfacing** — write-through failures and IPC errors (migration collision, missing tracked file) are now reported to the UI instead of being silently swallowed.
  - **Cross-platform path comparison** — the rebind dialog no longer triggers falsely when paths differ only by trailing slash or directory-separator style.

- a5f1cc0: feat: structured logging foundation

  - Every workspace package now logs through an injected `CoreLogger` instead of `console.*` — renderer and workspace signals both reach `main.log`.
  - Renderer `console.*` bridge preserves object structure (no more `[object Object]`) with an 8 KB per-arg size cap.
  - `runId` from `AsyncLocalStorage` auto-attaches to every log line inside a generation handler; IPC payloads unchanged.
  - Log file retention extended to 3 × 5 MB (`main.log` / `main.old.log` / `main.old.1.log`); rotation is resilient to Windows EBUSY / TOCTOU.
  - Legacy settings IPC deprecation warnings are deduped via `warnOnce` — first occurrence logs once, repeats are suppressed.
  - Biome enforces `no-console` in main / core / providers / exporters / shared.
  - `generationId` schema tightened to alphanumeric + `_`/`-`, max 128 chars (defense in depth for log-line injection).

  Breaking for out-of-tree consumers implementing `CoreLogger`: the interface now requires a `warn` method alongside `info` / `error`.

- 4c66392: # v0.2.0 — Agent Loop & Harness

  v0.2 swaps the bespoke pi-agent-core integration for the richer
  `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` SDK and rebuilds the agent harness
  around it. This is the largest internal change since v0.1.0 was cut.

  ## Highlights

  - **pi-coding-agent (0.69.0) integration.** A new
    `createCodesignSession()` boundary owns session creation, the bash
    permission hook, model registry, and resource-loader extension
    factories. Legacy `generate()` flow is left intact for backwards
    compat — consumers migrate incrementally.
  - **JSONL session storage.** Designs are now `SessionManager`-managed
    JSONL files under `<userData>/sessions/`. The old SQLite tables for
    `snapshots` / `chat_messages` / `comments` are deleted.
  - **Bash permission gating.** `tool_call` extension hook gates every
    bash invocation; renderer surfaces a 3-button modal (Deny / Allow
    once / Always allow). A hard-coded blocklist refuses
    `rm -rf /`, `sudo`, `curl ... | sh`, and `npm/pnpm/yarn/cargo
publish` without ever escalating to the user.
  - **Workspace FSWatcher.** `node:fs.watch` (recursive) drives a
    per-design `fs:event` channel — external editors (VSCode, etc.)
    hot-reload the preview tab without going through the agent.
  - **Brand acquisition + multi-screen baton.** Two new system-prompt
    sections enforce sourcing brand colors from real CSS (never from
    memory) and propagating tokens through a workspace `DESIGN.md` so
    multi-screen projects stay visually consistent.
  - **Built-in catalogues.**
    - 30 scaffold starters (device frames, browser chrome, dev mockups,
      UI primitives, backgrounds, decks, landing).
    - 5 new P0 design skills (`form-layout`, `empty-states`,
      `loading-skeleton`, `surface-elevation`, `cjk-typography`) on top
      of the existing 4 builtins.
    - 25 brand DESIGN.md references (vercel, linear, stripe, figma,
      notion, apple, airbnb, spotify, cursor, supabase, posthog,
      framer, runwayml, mistral, elevenlabs, coinbase, revolut, nike,
      ferrari, spacex, starbucks, shopify, ibm, raycast, cal-com).
  - **v0.1 → v0.2 migration.** First-launch detector pops a dialog when
    it finds an old `designs.db`, materialises each design into its own
    workspace, replays chat into a JSONL session, and renames the
    source DB to `designs.db.v0.1.backup`. Per-design failures are
    surfaced and the rest of the migration continues.
  - **Background process registry.** Tab-model lifecycle for dev
    servers — SIGTERM (3 s) → SIGKILL on tab close, ≤3 procs/design,
    ≤10 global, port auto-detected from stdout.
  - **Capability-driven tool exposure.** `gen_image` only appears when
    an OpenAI provider is configured; `preview` returns screenshots
    only for vision-capable models.

  ## Deprecations / breaking

  - **Removed**: `snapshots-ipc`, `chat-messages-ipc`, `comments-ipc`
    IPC channels. Renderer-side consumers were stubbed; v0.2.x will
    reroute them through the session JSONL.
  - **Renamed**: `apps/desktop/src/main/snapshots-db.ts` →
    `designs-db.ts` (its only remaining job is `diagnostic_events`).
  - **Pinned**: `@mariozechner/pi-ai` and `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`
    upgraded from `^0.67.68` to `^0.69.0`. New dep:
    `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent ^0.69.0`.

  ## Migration

  First launch on v0.2 with a v0.1 install: a dialog will appear asking
  to migrate. Choose yes; the source DB stays as `designs.db.v0.1.backup`
  in `<userData>` so you can manually inspect anything that didn't make
  it across.

  ## Known limitations

  - The new tools (`ask`, `scaffold`, `skill`, `preview`, `tweaks`) ship
    with their wire-format contracts and unit-tested logic, but the
    end-to-end glue (renderer modals, sandbox iframe round-trip) lands
    in a v0.2.x patch series — see `docs/v0.2-final-report.md`.
  - `T5.3` Playwright E2E and `T5.4` migration fixture suites are
    scaffolded as TODOs; current coverage is via in-process vitest
    cases against the migration helper.
  - Pre-existing lint debt (`Settings.tsx` cognitive complexity, a
    handful of `text-[10px]` literals outside FilesPanel/FilesTabView)
    is tracked separately.

- d3a62fe: feat(providers): first-class Ollama support + editable custom providers

  - Ollama joins the builtin provider set. `requiresApiKey: false` on the schema lets any provider — builtin or custom — opt out of API keys; `isKeylessProviderAllowed` now honors it. `extractModelIds` accepts the `{name}` shape used by Ollama's `/api/tags` endpoint as a fallback.
  - New `ollama:v1:probe` IPC does a 2s liveness check against `http://localhost:11434/api/tags`, so the UI can distinguish "running", "not installed", and "unreachable" states without racing the 10s models-list timeout.
  - Custom and builtin providers now have an `Edit` action. `AddCustomProviderModal` accepts an `editTarget` prop that pre-fills every field and routes save through `updateProvider` (rotates the stored secret only when the user actually types a new one — leaving it blank keeps the current mask). Builtin rows lock `baseUrl`/`wire` so users can't accidentally repoint `anthropic` at an unrelated host; only the API key and default model are editable.
  - `config:v1:update-provider` gained an optional `apiKey` field with tri-state semantics (omit = keep, empty string = clear, non-empty = rotate). Runs against missing-entry builtins too, seeding from `BUILTIN_PROVIDERS` so edits work on fresh installs.

### Patch Changes

- b8645d9: fix: keep chatgpt-codex meta replies as plain text

  - `chatgpt-codex` no longer turns non-design or meta prompts like "你是什么模型" into an immediate `design.html` artifact.
  - The Codex generate path now separates artifact HTML from surrounding assistant text, matching the main generate pipeline more closely.
  - The renderer only marks a run as `artifact_delivered` when an actual artifact exists, so plain-text replies no longer appear as generated files.

- 4c66392: Harden HTML, URL, marker, stack-frame, and retry parsing paths flagged by CodeQL during the v0.2 mainline promotion.
- a965e58: fix: send attached screenshots to ChatGPT Codex as image inputs

  Image attachments in the desktop app were previously reduced to filename-only hints on the `chatgpt-codex` route, so models like `gpt-5.4` could ignore uploaded screenshots entirely.

  This change keeps the existing text-attachment behavior, but reads supported image files into data URLs and forwards them as Responses `input_image` parts for ChatGPT Codex generations.

- 3d7b74e: feat(settings): auto-detect running CLIProxyAPI and show import banner

  When the Models tab mounts, probes `http://127.0.0.1:8317/v1/models` via the existing `testEndpoint` IPC bridge. If CLIProxyAPI is running and no provider is already configured at that address, displays a `LocalCpaImportCard` banner above the provider list offering one-click import into `AddCustomProviderModal`. The banner is dismissible and the preference persists to `localStorage` via key `cpa-detection-dismissed-v1`.

- 0a0ff2e: feat(settings): auto-discover models in custom provider modal

  When adding a custom provider (e.g. a CPA at http://127.0.0.1:8317), the modal now probes the endpoint automatically after the user types a valid http(s) baseUrl, debouncing 500ms. A spinner appears inline next to the "Default model" label while discovery runs, then either a green "Found N models" badge or a muted "Could not connect" hint.

  On success the "Default model" input becomes a `<select>` pre-populated with discovered model IDs, with smart auto-selection prioritising claude-sonnet-4-5 → claude-opus → claude-sonnet → gemini-2.5-pro → gpt-5 → first in list. A "Enter manually" escape hatch lets users type any ID instead, and a "Pick from list" link restores the dropdown. The probe re-fires when the API key or wire protocol changes. Empty or non-http(s) baseUrls are skipped so the existing manual flow is completely unaffected.

- 576e341: Block design system linking before onboarding and show a friendly renderer diagnostic instead of surfacing the main-process guard error.
- 69d09fa: Improve exporter fidelity by resolving workspace-local assets, bundling ZIP resources, preserving Markdown tables, supporting PDF header/footer options, and rendering PPTX slides from Chrome screenshots.
- 8058752: Show a virtual `index.html` in the Files panel when a generated preview exists but no workspace file rows are available.
- bbf69c7: Fix: allow larger binary attachments (images/png) up to 10MB. Binary attachments only contribute filename to context so size limit can be larger.
- a799cab: Show a friendly localized message when ChatGPT OAuth rejects token exchange for unsupported countries or regions.
- 011b25d: Fix: preserve the generation-timeout reason so long runs no longer surface a bare "Request was aborted." Provider SDKs rewrite aborted fetches into a generic message that drops `signal.reason`; the generate IPC now re-surfaces the stashed `GENERATION_TIMEOUT` CodesignError (with configured seconds + Settings path) when the controller was aborted by our own timer. Settings → Advanced → Generation timeout also gains 10m / 20m / 30m / 1h / 2h choices so the default 1200s and longer full-PDP runs can actually be configured without the dropdown silently downgrading the stored value.
- b793a8f: Fix Settings so Ollama is hidden until users add the local provider manually.
- 418e5a8: Classify 403 generation responses that say requests were blocked as gateway or reverse-proxy blocks instead of invalid API keys.
- 022e1b6: feat(diagnostics): bridge generate failures to diagnose() hypotheses (#130)

  - Main process `codesign:v1:generate` catch block now tags the thrown error with `upstream_status` / `upstream_provider` / `upstream_baseurl` / `upstream_wire` so the renderer can reason about the failure without re-parsing `err.message`.
  - New `diagnoseGenerateFailure()` in `@open-codesign/shared` maps generate-time failures to the same `DiagnosticHypothesis` shape the connection-test path already uses: 404 / "404 page not found" → missing `/v1`; 5xx with "not implemented" or "page not found" body → gateway does not implement the provider API; 400 with "instructions" body → openai-responses wire misconfigured; 401/403/429 reuse existing hypotheses.
  - Renderer `applyGenerateError` now appends the most-likely-cause sentence to the failure toast description and, for the missing-`/v1` case, surfaces an "Apply fix" action that updates the provider's baseUrl via `config:v1:update-provider` — addressing the Win11 relay-gateway failure in #130 with a one-click fix rather than a dead-end error message.
  - Adds new i18n cause keys (`gatewayIncompatible`, `openaiResponsesMisconfigured`, `serverError`) and fix keys (`switchWire`) in en + zh-CN.

- aa37f6f: Harden desktop provider setup by sanitizing agent-supplied SVG choice icons, storing new API keys with Electron safeStorage when available, redacting encrypted secret rows from diagnostics, and requiring explicit opt-in before testing local or private-network provider URLs.
- 441e7c7: fix: adversarial review round 2 — close remaining CRITICAL / HIGH privacy gaps

  A second adversarial review pass turned up three critical + four high-severity issues the first round missed. All fixed here.

  **Privacy (CRITICAL):**

  - Bundle's `main.log` was being zipped raw — completely bypassing the user's `includePromptText / includePaths / includeUrls` toggles. A user unchecking "Include paths" to protect `~/Users/name/...` still had those paths go verbatim to the public GitHub issue via the zipped log. Now every line of `main.log` in the bundle runs through the same per-line scrubber as `summary.md`. The generic "Export diagnostic bundle" button (no per-event toggles) defaults to redacting all three categories — safest choice.
  - Report dialog's preview now honors the redaction toggles live. Previously the `<pre>` showed `event.message` verbatim regardless of toggle state, so users had no way to verify redaction. A new client-side `redact.ts` mirrors the main-process regexes exactly (all 3 branches of `scrubPromptInLine`), and the preview re-runs on every toggle change. Provider-scope events now also display an "Upstream context" block (provider, status, request-id, retry count, redacted body head) — previously the body head was posted publicly without ever being shown to the reporter.
  - Path redaction regex broadened to cover `/var/folders/...` (macOS tmp), `/tmp/...`, `/etc/...`, `/private/var/...`. These paths routinely appear in fs error messages and were leaking before.

  **Correctness (HIGH):**

  - `preferences-ipc.ts` schema migration 4→5 no longer seeds `diagnosticsLastReadTs` to `0`. Upgrading users were getting a "99+" unread badge on first launch (every historical error row counted as unread). Now the migration seeds to `Date.now()` — fresh installs still start at 0 because the DB is empty too.
  - `providerContext` store no longer evicts an unrelated run's context when a second `provider.error` event arrives for an already-tracked run.
  - `writeAtomic` now unlinks its tmp file on write/rename failure, and a `cleanupStaleTmps` sweep on boot removes litter left by crashed processes.

- e622d62: fix: 3-reviewer adversarial round — privacy, UX, correctness

  Third consolidated round of fixes from three parallel adversarial reviewers.

  **Privacy (from R1):**

  - Issue URL `logs=` and `actual=` fields now go through the same redact pipeline as `summary.md`. Previously the URL (which ends up in browser history + referrer + shell history) silently ignored the user's redact toggles.
  - `bundlePath` in the issue URL now renders as `~/Downloads/...` rather than `/Users/<realUsername>/...`, so OS username isn't leaked through the link.
  - `config-redacted.toml` now applies path + URL redaction per toggle, so raw IPs in `baseUrl` and filesystem paths in `[designSystem]` get masked when the user unchecks Paths/URLs. The filename is no longer a lie.
  - `API_KEY_RE` broadened to catch Google Gemini `AIzaSy…`, AWS `AKIA…`, and 43-char Azure base64 keys.
  - `setWindowOpenHandler` is now gated through `isAllowedExternalUrl`, matching the existing allowlist for the IPC channel.
  - `showItemInFolder` rejects paths outside config/logs/Downloads to prevent a compromised renderer from revealing arbitrary files in Finder.

  **UX (from R2):**

  - Redaction placeholders changed from `<prompt omitted>` / `<path omitted>` / `<url omitted>` to `[prompt omitted]` / `[path omitted]` / `[url omitted]`. GitHub's markdown renderer was stripping the angle-bracket form as HTML tags, leaving users and triagers looking at empty redacted fields.
  - `summary.md` Message field now uses a backtick-safe inline code span (`mdInlineCode`), so error messages containing backticks don't eat the lines that follow.
  - Report dialog panel has `max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto` so buttons stay on-screen at 1280×720 viewports.
  - Dedup warning now shows the prior issue number (`#123`) when extractable from the stored URL.
  - Confirm step ("Yes, open anyway") has a 60-second countdown visible on the button.
  - Notes-too-long error is now localized.
  - Toast Report button shows a Loader2 spinner while the auto-record IPC is resolving.
  - Report bundle-saved toast only appears AFTER `openExternal` / `clipboard.writeText` succeeds, so a silent failure doesn't flash a green success toast alongside an error banner.
  - User notes are now injected into the bug_report.yml `actual` field, not just the zipped bundle.
  - Windows `platform_version` maps NT build (`10.0.22631`) to marketing name (`Windows 11 (10.0.22631)`).

  **Correctness (from R3):**

  - Fingerprint basis includes a hash of `message` when the stack is empty. Previously all renderer errors without stacks collapsed to the same fingerprint and triggered false "already reported" warnings.
  - `ReportEventDialog` is now mounted once at the App root via a single store slice (`activeReportEventId`). Previously each error toast mounted its own dialog, so opening Report on two toasts stacked two overlays.

  **i18n:**

  - Filled in three missing English keys (`loading.tokens`, `settings.providers.missingKey`, `settings.providers.addKey`).
  - `{relative}` single-brace interpolation finally fixed (it was rendering literally because i18next expects `{{relative}}`).

  **Test coverage:**

  - Added regression tests for each privacy leak, the fingerprint collision, the store's auto-record chain, and the dedup countdown.
  - 779 desktop + 153 shared tests pass.

- d815de5: fix: logging / diagnostics follow-ups from adversarial review

  Addresses 11 bugs and UX gaps found in an adversarial review of PR1-5:

  **Data correctness:**

  - Provider error context (upstream_request_id, upstream_status, retry_count, redacted_body_head) is now carried from the transient retry rows through to the final event row that users actually Report on — previously it lived only on a hidden sibling row.
  - `generateTitle` now routes through `completeWithRetry`, so title-generation failures emit the same structured `provider.error` events as regular generations instead of bubbling as raw exceptions.
  - The Report button on error toasts now resolves the exact event by `runId` rather than falling back to "the most recent diagnostic event" — so with multiple errors in flight each toast opens the right dialog. When no matching event is recorded yet, the button is disabled with a tooltip.
  - ErrorBoundary's Report button captures a timestamp on fallback mount and only accepts events recorded after it — render crashes no longer report whatever unrelated old error happened to be at index 0.

  **Privacy:**

  - Dropped the `请` / length-based heuristic in `looksLikePrompt` that was wiping out any Chinese error message longer than 200 chars containing the common word "请". Detection is now purely structural (JSON-key / field-marker patterns).
  - Log tail inside `summary.md` now scrubs prompt JSON per-line when `includePromptText` is off, rather than only replacing whole lines that matched a coarse heuristic.

  **UX:**

  - Diagnostics panel distinguishes "no events yet" from "snapshots DB unavailable" — the latter shows a warning pointing at main.log instead of cheerfully reporting zero failures.
  - After clicking Open Issue / Copy summary in the Report dialog, a toast confirms where the bundle was saved and offers a "Show in folder" action so users can actually attach it to the GitHub issue.
  - Report dialog auto-focuses the notes textarea on open and traps Tab/Shift-Tab within the dialog.

  **Defense in depth:**

  - Main-process IPC now caps `notes` at 4000 chars and `timeline` at 100 entries — a compromised renderer can no longer push 50 MB payloads.

  **Housekeeping:**

  - Cleaned stale TODO referencing the now-shipped Settings surface.

- b2a6d15: fix: close v1.0-blocking gaps in the logging / diagnostics pipeline

  Addresses every "must ship before v1.0" item surfaced by the adversarial review, plus a handful of close-to-free UX polish.

  **Main-process hardening:**

  - Boot-phase dialog now gates on `app.isReady()` — calling `dialog.showMessageBoxSync` before the framework is ready on Win/Linux is undefined; if we're pre-ready we write the path to stderr instead and let the user find the boot-errors.log manually.
  - Post-init listeners (`app.on('activate', …)`) now route `createWindow()` throws through the same boot-fallback writer + gated dialog instead of silently swallowing.
  - `reported-fingerprints.json` writes are atomic (`writeFileSync(tmp) → renameSync`) so a crash between truncate and write, or two concurrent Electron instances, can no longer clobber the file.
  - Redaction regex in `summary.md` generation now covers Windows drive-letter, UNC, `~/…`, `/root`, `/opt`, `/Applications`; URL regex adds `wss?:` and `file:`. Negative test guards against false-positives on dates and ratios.

  **Renderer polish:**

  - Unread-error badge `lastReadTs` is now persisted via the preferences IPC, so marking diagnostics read survives a restart.
  - Error toasts cap at 3 — a new error drops the oldest to prevent the viewport filling with sticky stacks.
  - Badge above 99 renders as `99+` so the TopBar doesn't widen unboundedly.
  - Report dialog's four redaction toggles now carry inline hints explaining what each one reveals.

  **Internal:**

  - `providerContext` store extracted into its own module with direct test coverage.

- 4c66392: refactor: make create prompts manifest-first

  - Replace keyword-routed create prompt composition with deterministic base sections plus resource manifest summaries.
  - Move heavyweight guidance into lazy-loaded skills and remove stale single-shot artifact prompt exports.
  - Remove full skill body injection helpers and demote old tool names in the chat working-card UI.
  - Add artifact composition, chart rendering, and craft polish skill manifests for explicit progressive disclosure.

- 863db3c: feat(ui): search input in model switcher dropdown

  Long provider catalogs (DeepSeek, Zhipu, OpenRouter, …) return 40+ model IDs; scrolling by wheel to find the one you actually use is painful. The topbar/sidebar model switcher now shows a search box at the top of the dropdown whenever the list crosses an 8-item threshold, filtering case-insensitively by substring. Path-style IDs (`deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B`) and tag-style IDs (`llama3.2:latest`) both match naturally.

  The input auto-focuses on open, resets when the dropdown closes, and renders a distinct "no matches for <query>" message so users can tell a search miss apart from a provider with genuinely zero models.

  Community request from chengmo — thanks for the nudge.

- 4111928: Disable startup update checks by default and treat missing electron-updater channel metadata as a non-error condition.
- 41efd48: Repair stale user scaffold manifests with missing bundled metadata so built-in scaffold validation stays healthy after upgrades.
- 4c66392: fix: align build, tool prompts, and model switcher token output

  - Keep root and desktop builds on the fast Vite compilation path, with installer packaging available through explicit package/release scripts.
  - Bundle local `@open-codesign/*` workspace packages into the desktop main bundle so electron-builder only packages true runtime externals.
  - Prune packaged dependency noise such as source maps, declaration files, tests, examples, unused Electron languages, and non-target native binaries from the desktop app bundle.
  - Fail packaging when the target better-sqlite3 Electron native binary is missing, instead of shipping an app that crashes on database open.
  - Merge newly bundled template files into existing user template folders without overwriting user edits, so manifest-first skills are available after upgrades.
  - Route v0.1 database migration through the same better-sqlite3 native binding resolver used by the app database, so package pruning does not break migration.
  - Materialize legacy assistant chat rows as valid pi session messages during v0.1 to v0.2 migration.
  - Pin the `@xmldom/xmldom` security override to `0.8.13` to avoid electron-builder plist parsing failures from `0.9.x`.
  - Remove a redundant dynamic import that made Vite warn during the desktop main build.
  - Align agent-facing edit instructions with the real `str_replace_based_edit_tool` command payload and remove unused legacy helper tool factories from core.
  - Treat `view_range` `-1` bounds as EOF so ranged views cannot bypass the full-file view budget.
  - Keep model-facing `view_range` guidance consistent with the EOF behavior and add desktop package metadata used by electron-builder.
  - Wrap selected artifact DOM snippets, reference URL excerpts, and local attachment text as escaped untrusted context, injected once at the agent boundary.
  - Escape untrusted-context wrapper metadata and restrict reference URL prefetching, including redirects, to non-credentialed HTTP(S) URLs.
  - Reject reference URL hosts that are localhost, private/link-local/reserved IPs, or resolve through DNS to blocked addresses before fetching any content.
  - Apply the Reference URL timeout to DNS resolution as well as fetch, so a stuck resolver cannot hang generation before the HTTP request starts.
  - Use a Node HTTP(S) fetcher with a guarded connection-time DNS lookup so a host cannot pass preflight DNS validation and then rebind to a blocked address during the actual request.
  - Reject empty or relative workspace paths at bind/update time and revalidate stored workspace paths before filesystem reads or writes, so corrupt bindings cannot silently write relative to the app cwd.
  - Require workspace paths to be absolute for the current platform, so Windows drive paths are not treated as cwd-relative folders on macOS/Linux, and Windows normalization stays fully qualified.
  - Make `codesign:files:v1:list` fail fast for missing designs, unbound workspaces, and corrupt stored workspace paths instead of reporting an empty directory.
  - Make workspace file watcher subscriptions fail fast with typed IPC errors, validate stored workspace paths before watching, and restart the watcher when a design is rebound to a different workspace.
  - Make the renderer file-list hook track the current workspace binding, skip workspace IPC calls when no workspace is bound, and surface watcher subscription failures instead of silently ignoring them.
  - Create and duplicate designs with an atomic workspace binding step, hiding failed rows instead of returning workspace-less designs.
  - Roll back failed create/duplicate workspace allocation by deleting only auto-created workspace directories and hard-deleting incomplete DB rows so cloned snapshots/files do not linger behind a hidden design.
  - Revalidate stored workspace paths before generation and session JSONL access, so corrupt bindings cannot become a generation cwd.
  - Require workspace binding targets to be real directories and surface missing/non-directory selections as input errors.
  - Reject product-level attempts to clear a design workspace, while keeping low-level nullable schema behavior only for legacy/migration compatibility.
  - Copy tracked workspace files and `design_files` mirrors when duplicating a design, and reject workspace-less legacy sources before cloning.
  - Require `designId` and a bound workspace for generation so agent runs cannot succeed without a real design workspace.
  - Remove the old chat-session `defaultCwd` fallback and reject unbound legacy designs at chat/runtime filesystem boundaries.
  - Add localized `WORKSPACE_MISSING` copy and update null-workspace UI text to describe the legacy unbound state explicitly.
  - Reject workspace reads, writes, runtime write-through, and tracked-file copies that traverse symlinked path segments inside the workspace.
  - Reject symlink traversal in scaffold writes, skill/brand-reference loads, frame/design-skill template loads, project-context reads, preview source reads, and preview `file://` asset requests.
  - Restore the done-runtime load-error formatter contract and redact self-contained data URLs so verifier failures do not dump large srcdoc payloads.
  - Surface workspace file-list IPC failures in the renderer instead of silently rendering an empty file list.
  - Fail fast on incomplete `str_replace_based_edit_tool` command payloads instead of silently defaulting missing edit fields, and reject `insert` against missing files.
  - Keep the skill loader genuinely lazy by removing top-level runtime re-exports and dynamically importing it from the `skill` tool only when a manifest is requested.
  - Add missing localized copy for `GENERATION_INCOMPLETE` so every shared error code has user-facing text.
  - Preserve v0.1 inline comments during migration, close the legacy database before backup rename, allocate a unique backup name when an older backup exists, and validate legacy file paths before creating workspace directories.
  - Make better-sqlite3 native binding resolution fail fast instead of falling back from Electron to the default Node ABI binary.
  - Add hyphenated spacing token aliases so Tailwind arbitrary `calc()` values emit valid CSS.

- 5d22e60: fix(renderer): Settings active-provider card no longer misrepresents the current model

  When the `/models` endpoint returns a partial list (or one that does not include the currently-active model id — common with custom gateways, manually-edited TOML, or provider-specific aliasing), the native `<select>` fell back to rendering `options[0]`. The card then visually claimed the active model was whatever happened to sit at the top of the fetched list, while the top-bar `ModelSwitcher` and the actual generation request still used the real active id (see issue #136).

  Now when `config.modelPrimary` is not in the fetched list, the active id is pinned at the top of the dropdown with an `(active, not in provider list)` hint. The select always matches reality, and users can see at a glance that their configured model is not one the provider advertised — a useful signal when debugging 4xx errors (related: #124, #134).

- 90f25d0: Show a clearer transport-interrupted explanation when generation fails with opaque `terminated` errors.
- 8fc9f56: Fall back to polling workspace files when native recursive watching is blocked by permission errors.
- cd71db4: Show clearer guidance when a workspace folder is already bound to another design.
- 75f2e2a: Load existing workspace text files into the agent runtime and serve preview-relative workspace assets through a bounded `workspace://` protocol.
