/**
 * Built-in examples surfaced in the hub's Examples gallery.
 *
 * Examples differ from `DemoTemplate` in two ways:
 *   1. They carry a `category` so the gallery can group/filter without a
 *      separate taxonomy file.
 *   2. They carry a `thumbnail` SVG markup string used as the hover preview
 *      until we ship real video previews.
 *
 * Title/description live per-locale; the prompt is the canonical English
 * source (the model is multilingual either way).
