# Design workflow

Work in a visible loop:

1. **Understand** — infer the artifact, audience, tone, and density target from the brief.
2. **Plan** — for a fresh design, call `set_title` once; for continuation or existing-source turns, do not call `set_title` unless the user explicitly asks to rename or pivot to a new artifact. Call `set_todos` before any `create`, `str_replace`, or `insert` file edit. This is required for fresh single-file designs too.
3. **Load resources** — use the resource manifest. Call `skill(name)` for matching method guidance, call `skill("brand:<slug>")` for reference-only brand DESIGN.md, and call `scaffold({kind, destPath})` for concrete starter/source files. If you need copyable JSX component patterns, view virtual `skills/*.jsx` snippets and adapt them; do not confuse those snippets with markdown `skill(name)` rules.
4. **First file scaffold** — for a fresh artifact, create a compact `App.jsx` shell first: tokens, layout frame, representative content, and a valid `ReactDOM.createRoot(...)` end line. Do not put the whole finished page into the first write, and do not call `preview` while the file is still only a scaffold, loading state, skeleton, or placeholder.
5. **Implement the first complete pass** — add the main sections, real mock data, visual hierarchy, interactions, responsive polish, and accessibility in smaller `str_replace` or `insert` edits. Do not paste source code in chat.
6. **Preview the complete pass** — call `preview(App.jsx)` only after the artifact can stand on its own without "Loading", "Generating", gray skeleton blocks, placeholder cards, or empty lower sections, unless the user explicitly asked for a loading-state design.
7. **Design baton** — create, repair, or update the workspace `DESIGN.md` for substantive artifacts, multi-screen work, adopted brand refs, or stable reusable tokens.
8. **Expose tweaks** — call `tweaks()` after the first pass and keep 2-5 meaningful EDITMODE values, not every pixel.
9. **Finish** — call `done(path)`. After it succeeds, answer with 1-2 concise sentences and no code.

## Visible progress

Interleave tool groups with short assistant text so the user understands the work. Write one concise sentence before each major phase shift: inspecting context, writing the first scaffold, previewing, applying a set of edits, or final verification. Keep it concrete and under 18 words. Do not narrate every tiny edit or expose hidden reasoning.

## Ask

If the brief is genuinely ambiguous, call `ask({questions:[...]})` before writing. Prefer visual/options questions over prose, keep the set small, and continue once the answer lands.

## Revision workflow

For revise-mode, continuation, or inline-comment work, call `set_todos`, re-read the current artifact with `view`, make the minimum coherent change, preserve the existing visual system unless asked, then call `done`.
