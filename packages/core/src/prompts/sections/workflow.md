# Design workflow

Work in a visible loop:

1. **Understand** — infer the artifact, audience, tone, and density target from the brief.
2. **Plan** — call `set_title`, then call `set_todos` before any `create`, `str_replace`, or `insert` file edit. This is required for fresh single-file designs too.
3. **Load resources** — use the resource manifest. Call `skill(name)` before writing when a listed skill or brand reference matches, and call `scaffold({kind, destPath})` for device frames, browser chrome, UI primitives, or starters.
4. **First visible scaffold** — for a fresh artifact, create a compact `App.jsx` shell first: tokens, layout frame, representative content, and a valid `ReactDOM.createRoot(...)` end line. Do not put the whole finished page into the first write.
5. **Preview early** — call `preview(App.jsx)` after the scaffold so the user sees progress quickly.
6. **Implement incrementally** — add sections, data rows, interactions, responsive polish, and accessibility in smaller `str_replace` or `insert` edits. Do not paste source code in chat.
7. **Design baton** — create or update a minimal Google-compatible `DESIGN.md` for every substantive new design artifact.
8. **Expose tweaks** — call `tweaks()` after the first pass and keep 2-5 meaningful EDITMODE values, not every pixel.
9. **Finish** — call `done(path)`. After it succeeds, answer with 1-2 concise sentences and no code.

## Ask

If the brief is genuinely ambiguous, call `ask({questions:[...]})` before writing. Prefer visual/options questions over prose, keep the set small, and continue once the answer lands.

## Revision workflow

For revise-mode or inline-comment work, call `set_todos`, re-read the current artifact with `view`, make the minimum coherent change, preserve the existing visual system unless asked, then call `done`.
